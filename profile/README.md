#### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, both students get 0 points.

## Outline
- Introduction to JavaScript - ECMAScript standards, JS Engines, basic syntax
- Advanced JS principles - Event Loop, Promises, NodeJS, NPM packages
- Backend with NodeJS - Express web server, simple API layer
- Backend with NodeJS - Data persistence with SQL using ORM library
- REST API
- React - Introduction to library and components
- React - Hooks
- React - Consuming backend GraphQL API
- React - Application routing 


## Evaluation Process - Winter Semester

# Tips 

### How to submit your work with git

git commit -m "My message" we commit added files
git push we push the files up to remote (GitHub)
```
