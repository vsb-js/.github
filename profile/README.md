## Labs
- 01 N/A
  -  Homework:
      - Install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version (verify using `node -v` in terminal)
      - Install [git](https://desktop.github.com/) (verify using `git --verison` in terminal) - we highly recommend [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) if you haven't 
      - Make sure you have GitHub account and properly setup your machine to work with git (You should be able to push into your repositories on GitHub - you can use the GitHub desktop app to do that.
      - Install IDE of your choice for JS (Recommended [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Similary to PyCharm))
- 02 JavaScript Basics
  - Task: 

#### Labs evaluation
- Your work has to be submitted via GitHub classroom into your assigment repo before the deadline (7-14 days after the date of lab)
- 5 - 6  points for each lab 
  - 5 points - for finishing the tasks properly ((finished tasks / amount of tasks) * 5)
  - -1 point - if we can not run your file / project should be without error! 

### Project - FE React App
- Assignment: TODO
- Deadline: TODO
- Project information: TODO
- Will be in pairs (2 people per team)   

  
#### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, both students get 0 points.

## Abstract
This course builds on the theoretical knowledge the student has learned in previous years about building software systems and puts them into practice in the world of JavaScript language. In this course students will learn how t

## Outline
- Introduction to JavaScript - ECMAScript standards, JS Engines, basic syntax
- Advanced JS principles - Event Loop, Promises, NodeJS, NPM packages
- Backend with NodeJS - Express web server, simple API layer
- Backend with NodeJS - Data persistence with SQL using ORM library
- REST API
- React - Introduction to library and components
- React - Hooks
- React - Consuming backend GraphQL API
- React - Application routing 


## Evaluation Process - Winter Semester

# Tips 

### How to submit your work with git
