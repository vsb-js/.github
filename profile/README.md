#### Labs evaluation
- Your work has to be submitted via GitHub classroom into your assigment repo before the deadline (7-14 days after the date of lab)
- 5 - 6  points for each lab 
  - 5 points - for finishing the tasks properly ((finished tasks / amount of tasks) * 5)
  - -1 point - if we can not run your file / project should be without error! 

### Project - FE & BE React App
- Assignment: TODO 
- Deadline: TODO
- Project information: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn8qX5Meg4MHuIiGZNzHfnLpvN2YuczotkRvW4s9ZuE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Will be in pairs (2 people per team)   

Points from the subject can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WWXOO-Md-nbDdXOcOGv4hJRuxvbpoljmWnSZAKQoGuI/edit?usp=sharing).

  
#### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, both students get 0 points.

## Outline
- Introduction to JavaScript - ECMAScript standards, JS Engines, basic syntax
- Advanced JS principles - Event Loop, Promises, NodeJS, NPM packages
